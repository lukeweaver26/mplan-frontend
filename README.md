Follow these instructions in order to run:

- Make sure you have node installed on your computer, I am running v18.14.0 but any version should work
- go to project root directory in terminal
- create a file called .env and paste this:
  ```
  REACT_APP_CLIENT_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3000"
  REACT_APP_SERVER_BASE_URL="http://localhost:4000"
  ```
- run these commands in terminal:
    ```
    npm i -g nodemon
    npm i
    npm start
    ```
The application should then pop up on a browser
